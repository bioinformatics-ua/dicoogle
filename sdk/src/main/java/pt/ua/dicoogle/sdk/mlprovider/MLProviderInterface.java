 * Interface to define Machine Learning providers.
 * A machine learning provider can be a remote service, hosted on the cloud, or a simple remote/local server
 * that has machine learning algorithms installed for problem solving.
 * Machine learning providers can work with either image or csv datasets.
 * The purpose of this interface is to provide a way
