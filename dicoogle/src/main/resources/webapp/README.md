# Dicoogle Web Application

## Building

The web application is built using Node.js, npm, and webpack (see [package.json](package.json)). To build everything for production (ready to be bundled for when creating dicoogle.jar):

    npm install     # install npm dependencies
    npm run build   # build everything for production

To build all js, styles and html resources:

    npm run build        # for production
    npm run build-debug  # for development

To build and watch for changes, you can run the webpack development server via the `start` script:

    npm start

## Running as a standalone server

We have included a script for running a static server containing the standalone webapp.
If you already have Python installed, execute:

```sh
./run_server
```

But other static HTTP servers may be used as well.

## Debugging the webapp

The web application can be tested separately without having it embedded in a jar file. The steps are simple:

1. Start Dicoogle, locally or on a server: `java -jar dicoogle.jar -s`. The jar file does not need to contain the web application in this case. You may also need to change your configuration in the config.xml file, so as to enable cross-origin requests:

```xml
<server enable="true" port="8080" allowedOrigins="*" />
```

2. Navigate to the webapp's source code. Define the URL to Dicoogle's base endpoint using the `DICOOGLE_BASE_URL` environment variable, and run the webpack development server:

```
DICOOGLE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 npm start
```

This will deploy a server with automatic refresh on changes.

You can also run one of the other scripts available and deploy a static server on the webapp's base folder:

```
DICOOGLE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 npm run build-debug
./run_server
```

See the **Building** section above for more scripts.
